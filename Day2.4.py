# Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.*

# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5

# Then, the output of the program should be:

# [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

# Row*column print ho ra hh


x, y = map(int, input().split(","))

list = []
for i in range(x):
    temp = []
    for j in range(y):
        temp.append(i * j)
    list.append(temp)

print(list)


#x,y = map(int,input().split(','))
#lst = [[i*j for j in range(y)] for i in range(x)]
#print(lst)
